# Respiratory-Rate-PPG-ECG Repository

The **Respiratory-Rate-PPG-ECG** repository offers methods to estimate respiratory rate using signals from wearable devices, specifically Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG). It includes both signal processing techniques and deep learning models to predict respiratory rates.

## Features
- **Signal Processing Methods:** Techniques to extract respiratory rate from ECG and PPG signals.
- **Machine Learning Methods:** Include deep learning pre-trained models & other machine learning approaches for respiratory rate estimation.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oucru-Innovations/Respiratory-Rate-PPG-ECG.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Respiratory-Rate-PPG-ECG
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
